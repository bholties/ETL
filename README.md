1)	We are analyzing a craft beer CSV file, a craft beer brewery csv file, and a wine dataset CSV file.
2)	We will be using pandas to transform and combine both craft beer CSV files and the wine dataset CSV.
3)	We will have to combine both craft beer csv files. We will have to sort all of the craft beers by their brewery id so that you can see all of the specific beers from each brewery. We will also have to delete a couple of the columns as they are not useful.
4)	We will have to delete all null/N/A values in all three csv files
5)	For the winery data will only be using the data that is for the United States, which makes up 42% of that file. We will have to cut out all null values. There are 14 columns, and we will have to cut out at least 5 of them as they are not useful for our project.
6)	We will loading it on AWS
